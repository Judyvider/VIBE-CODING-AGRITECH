AgriConnect
Empowering Farmers, Growing Communities
The Problem
Limited Information: Farmers lack access to up-to-date advice on crop disease and best practice.

Inefficient Markets: They cannot access consumers, resulting in low profits.

Digital Divide: Farmers lack smartphones, rendering them incapable of utilizing advanced tools.

The AgriConnect Solution
AgriConnect is an integrated platform that provides essential tools and a direct-to-consumer marketplace, all for the sake of accessibility.

The Local Market: Our Core Feature
We provide a direct-to-consumer platform where farmers can easily list their crops. This cuts out middlemen, and as a result, farmers receive a fairer price and local communities receive fresh, locally available products.

The Crop Advisor
Our online feature allows farmers to post a photo of a plant for on-the-spot diagnosis and actionable advice. This saves them from losing their crops and increasing their yield.

The USSD Advantage
AgriConnect's USSD functionality ensures everyone has access to basic services even in the absence of the internet or a smartphone. It's a simple, text-menu that anyone can use.

The Market Opportunity
We're targeting millions of smallholder farmers across a rapidly-digitizing economy. Our platform constructs an open and sustainable ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders.

Our Ask
We seek investment to expand our reach and scale our platform. We need to:

Develop Our AI: Teach our models to detect additional crop types and diseases.

Enhance Logistics: Integrate robust payment and delivery features.

Scale Operations: Open new territories and serve more farming communities.
