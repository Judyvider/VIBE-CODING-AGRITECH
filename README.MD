AgriConnect: A Digital Platform for Farmers
AgriConnect is a comprehensive digital platform designed to empower small-scale farmers with tools and resources. The application is built as a single-file HTML, CSS, and JavaScript web application, so it is lightweight and easy to deploy.

Features
1. AI-Powered Crop Advisor
Farmers can upload a picture of their plant and get instant advice on potential disease and remedy. This tool supports early detection and management of crop disease and minimizes losses.

2. Personalized Nutrition & Health Planner
This is a tool that generates healthy and balanced meal plans based on the available crops to the user. It enables better nutrition among farming households by utilizing local and seasonal crops.

3. Interactive Learning Modules
The platform includes short, educational modules on important topics like soil conservation, rainwater harvesting, and biological pest control. The modules provide bite-sized, actionable information to allow farmers to farm more sustainably.

4. Local Market & E-commerce
Farmers can list their surplus crops for sale to neighboring communities. The application facilitates a direct-to-consumer model, which means farmers get more fair prices for their produce and buyers get more access to food. The application now includes fields for farmer name and location to enhance transparency and connection between consumers and farmers. 

5. Payments Integration (Simulated)
The platform also includes a simulated payments section, where farmers can view payments from buyers and maintain a history of all transactions.

6. USSD Access
A key feature of AgriConnect is the simulated USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) functionality. With it, farmers who lack smartphones or internet access can interact with core features of the platform using a simple text-based menu.
